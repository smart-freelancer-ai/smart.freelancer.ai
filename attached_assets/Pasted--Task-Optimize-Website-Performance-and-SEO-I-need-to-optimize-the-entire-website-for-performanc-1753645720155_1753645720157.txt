# Task: Optimize Website Performance and SEO

I need to optimize the entire website for performance, SEO, and user experience. Ensure all changes are applied globally where applicable.

**Requirements:**

1.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Image Optimization:** Compress and optimize all images (if any were added directly to the project, not from external URLs) for faster loading without significant quality loss.
    *   **Code Splitting/Lazy Loading:** Implement code splitting for routes and components to load only necessary code.
    *   **Minification:** Ensure CSS, JavaScript, and HTML are minified.
    *   **Caching:** Implement browser caching for static assets.

2.  **SEO Optimization:**
    *   **Meta Tags:** Implement dynamic meta titles and descriptions for all pages (Home, Blog, Services, Contact) based on page content. Ensure they are SEO-friendly and in Arabic.
    *   **Open Graph Tags:** Add Open Graph tags for social media sharing (title, description, image, URL) for all pages.
    *   **Structured Data (Schema Markup):** Add basic Schema Markup (e.g., Organization, WebPage, BlogPosting for blog posts) to improve search engine understanding.
    *   **Sitemap:** Generate a sitemap.xml file.
    *   **Robots.txt:** Create a robots.txt file to guide search engine crawlers.
    *   **Semantic HTML:** Ensure proper use of semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer).
    *   **Alt Tags for Images:** Ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes in Arabic.

3.  **Accessibility (A11y) Improvements:**
    *   **ARIA Attributes:** Add necessary ARIA attributes for better screen reader compatibility.
    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable via keyboard.
    *   **Color Contrast:** Verify sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements.

4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **404 Page:** Create a custom 404 Not Found page.

**Design and Content Considerations:**
- All new content (meta tags, alt texts) must be in Arabic.
- Maintain the existing RTL layout and overall design consistency.

Please provide a detailed plan of your actions before executing, and confirm successful implementation of each optimization point.
